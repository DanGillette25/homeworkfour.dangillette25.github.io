This quiz application asks the user a series of five multiple choice questions to test their coding knowledge.  The user is given 60 seconds to complete all five questions.  If a question is answered incorrectly, a time penalty of 10 seconds is deducted from their time remaining.

Once the quiz is complete, the score is calculated by multiplying the number of seconds remaining by the number of questions that were answered correctly.

The vast majority of the functionality and logic are contained in the questions.js file.  The array storing the questions is stored in the questions.js file.

For code-specific clarification, please refer to the notes posted throughout each code document.
